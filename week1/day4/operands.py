give the option to quit
you are going to let the user type in 3 things, number operand number
put that info in a list
loop over the list, and depending on what the content is, you will call your functions
store that number, and display when they hit "="


if you did not use function
you will change your logic for operands. and make them into functions
you will give the user the ability to quit after they make a calculation or before they make a calculation with 'q'

PYTHON NOTES

python is a different language than JavaScript. For example we use "print()" instead of "console.log()"

[] is a list
a list can contain strings, booleans, integers, and floats

[word[word]] is a nested list

{:} is a dictionary
{"word":"word"}

inputs are accepted with variables and the input function
varible = input()

Using F strings with %s, %(variable)

name = david
print("hello my name is %", %name)
this will change with the variable. add additonal with parathens and variables

name = david
age = 30
print("hello my name is %, and my age is %" , %(name, age))
